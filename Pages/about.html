        <img src="../Images/selfie.jpg" alt="Candid photo of Me" class="image">
        <p> My name is Vince and I am a first year student at BCIT's 
            <strong>CIT program</strong>. I have a double major in 
            <em>Environmental Management</em> and <em>Geography</em> at the 
            University of Toronto and is currently looking 
            to switch career paths. My main hobby and side gig outside of school 
            is portrait photography.</p>
